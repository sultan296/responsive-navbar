# responsive navbar

Created a website that features a responsive navigation bar built using React and React Router. It dynamically updates the 
URL based on user interactions, highlights active links, and remains fixed at the top. The navbar adapts to different 
screen sizes, transitioning into a menu on smaller screens to enhance usability. Your implementation ensures smooth 
navigation while maintaining a visually appealing and user-friendly experience.
